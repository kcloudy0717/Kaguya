# Kaguya

This is a hobby project using DirectX 12 and DirectX RayTracing (DXR). This project is inspired by Peter Shirley and his ray tracing book series: [In One Weekend, The Next Week, The Rest of Your Life](https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io), Alan Wolfe's blog post series on [causual shadertoy path tracing](https://blog.demofox.org/2020/05/25/casual-shadertoy-path-tracing-1-basic-camera-diffuse-emissive/) and lastly [Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation](http://www.pbr-book.org/) by Matt Pharr, Wenzel Jakob, and Greg Humphreys. For those of you who haven't read any of these and would like to explore ray tracing, I highly recommend them!

# Features

## Graphics

- Render graph system
- Progressive stochastic path tracing
- Importance sampling of BSDFs and multiple importance sampling of lights
- Lambertian, Mirror, Glass, and Disney BSDFs
- Point and quad lights
- Real-time path tracing using both DXR 1.0 and DXR 1.1

## D3D12

- Bindless resource
- Asynchronous PSO compilation using coroutines and threadpools
- Utilization of graphics and asynchronous compute queues
- Acceleration structure compaction using modified [RTXMU](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/RTXMU)

## Misc

- Custom scene serialization using json
- Custom binary format for loading meshes and meshlets
- Asynchronous asset importing using threads
- Asset management using lightweight handles

## World

- Ecs with the following implemented components:
  - Core: Main component that all actor in the scene have, it contains tag that identifies the actor and a transform which controls position, scale, and orientation
  - Camera: controls camera parameters for scene viewing
  - Light: used to illuminate the scene, controls light parameters
    - Supported types:
      - Point
      - Quad
  - Static Mesh: references a mesh in the asset window to be rendered and controls material parameters and submits the referenced mesh to RaytracingAccelerationStructure for path tracing
    - Supported BSDFs:
      - Lambertian
      - Mirror
      - Glass
      - Disney
  - NativeScript: C++ scripting

# What I'm working on now/future

I'm currently modularizing the engine into libraries so they can be reused, I plan on extending Kaguya to more than just a path tracer using the new
render graph system. Vulkan support probably won't be soon until I figure out a robust way for abstracting resource binding to bindless model. I want to add a voxel renderer
so I can make my own minecraft, write a proper deferred renderer with pbr lighting (the knowledge of raytracing should make this process straightforward). Utilize new D3D12
features such as mesh shaders and the upcoming enhanced barrier that will replace old resource barriers. There's lots of things I want to do but going to take one step at a time.

For the moment, I think I'll work on a voxel renderer which will combine raster and raytracing to create a beautiful world.

## Future stuff to work on

- Voxel renderer
- Hybrid renderer (Raster & Raytracing)
- Explore spectral rendering and all kinds of stuff mentioned in PBRT (I really need to brush up my calculus to understand the theory)
- Readd physx back into World system
- GPU driven architecture
- Mesh shading using meshlets
- Vulkan support

# Build

- Visual Studio 2019 (I am using VS 2022, but 2019 should still work)
- GPU that supports DXR
- Windows SDK Version 10.0.19041.0
- Windows 10 Minimum Version: 20H2 (I am on Windows 11 insider build, older version should still work)
- CMake Version 3.16
- C++ 20

1. Initialize submodules after you have cloned, use `Setup.bat` to generate visual studio solution (Make sure you have CMake installed and is a environmental variable).

2. When the project is build, all the assets and required dlls will be copied to the directory of the executable. There is a folder containing all the scenes in the asset directory for the showcase, those can be loaded from the context menu of the World window of the application's UI.

Let me know if you have any trouble setting up the project and getting it up and running!
